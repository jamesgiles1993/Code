    "This is conditional on it being a double play.\n",
    "For all outs but groundouts, you can basically just take the guy on the randomly selected base and remove him\n",
    "So if there are guys on second and third and the second out is on third, remove the guy from third (this is a simplifying assumption, but it's also not really a big deal)\n",
    "A few times, this gets a little weird so there are exceptions made.\n",
    "If there is nobody on second base, for example, and that's where the out is, you can assume a runner tried going from first, so call him out.\n",
    "For ground outs, the base level assumption is that runners are out at the base they are advancing to, not the one they're currently at.\n",
    "So an out at second removes the runner at first by default.\n",
    "This also has some weird exceptions, including a tiny likelihood of a guy at first getting out at third, but this is rare (and probably could be fixed by rounding)"
